# Kens-All-Star-Repository
For Project 3 we created a Full Stack MERN web application. The concept of the web application is to make a functional website for a moving company where on the homepage users can view Ken's All Star Movers company information and contact information. Additionally, users can login to create, view, update, and delete a moving appointment with Ken's All Star Movers by completing a form.
